This is the basic method of evigene/scripts/overbestgene2.pl:
gene models with overlapping CDS exons are "the same locus", each model has some form of evidence score,
and the method picks out those models with highest evidence score.   The trick or trouble is mainly in applying
various evidence scores, and their combination, to return the best models that a human expert would pick.

basic usage:
  $evigene/scripts/overbestgene2.perl  \
  -scoretype='nintron:2,aalen:1,iste:-1,UTR:0.01,CDS:1.0' \
  -dropscore='*nintron:1,*aalen:150' \
  -pctover 5 -trivial 10 -summarize -skip -noONEBIN_GENES -novecscore \
  -in inbest2gsann.gff -out outbest2gsann.gff >& best2.log

where main parameters are
  -in inbest2gsann.gff is catenation of all gene models, annotated with evidence
  -out outbest2gsann.gff is best model/locus by evidence scores
  -scoretype is list of weighted gene attributes, commonly in mRNA annotation column 9
    nintron:2 means weight number of introns by 2 (2 * 2 introns = 4)
    aalen:1 weight amino/protein length by 1
  -dropscore lists minimum attribute scores to keep gene model, i.e. 
    drop model if aalen < 150aa AND nintron < 2  
    ( *nintron:1 == keep if >=1 intron, OR *aalen:150 == keep if aalen >= 150 aa )

  Each gene model in GFF must have row types: mRNA, exon and CDS,
  with mRNA ID=Idwhatever, and exon, CDS for that mRNA have Parent=Idwhatever
  mRNA has list of evidence scores in column 9, e.g.
    "ID=AUGcex2s1018g153t1;aalen=300;homolog=213,dapmaevg14:Dapma7bEVm019529t1;nintron=2/4;iste=64"
  
  Best model/locus is one with largest sum of weighted evidence scores.
  Models with overlapping CDS belong to one locus.
  A weighted score of above model is
    score= 20*213 (homolog) + 2*2 (nintron) + -1*64 (iste) + 1*300(aalen) + 0.01*UTRval
  Keep this model if all others with overlapping CDS have a lower score.  
    
  Only a few of these attributes are calculated by overbestgene2 (CDS, UTR, nintron),
  it is expected that you add evidence scores as attributes in mRNA lines of GFF.

my usage with evidence annotation
  $evigene/scripts/overbestgene2.perl -genegroup='homolog,ovpro:100' \
  -scoretype='homolog:20,ovpro:0.3,nintron:2,aalen:1,iste:-1,UTR:0.01,CDS:0.01' \
  -dropscore='*homolog:50,*nintron:2,ovpro:80,*aalen:150' \
  -pctover 5 -trivial 10 -summarize -skip -noONEBIN_GENES -novecscore \
  -in inbest2gsann.gff -out outbest2gsann.gff \
   > & log.ovb1

nintron as I use it is the percent of introns supported by RNA evidence, value of 0..100
genegroup is a special option for reference gene homolog scores with IDs,
to aid detection of joined/fused models (homolog score is same for long/false and short/true model)
