There are several ways to compute proteins from mRNA transcripts, with differing results.
Two classes are (a) basic codon lookup scan of RNA sequence for longest open reading
frames (ORFs), and (b) prediction from statistical models of coding sequences, including
coding/non-coding metrics, intron/exon models, sequence signals. One should be aware of
what a protein translator is doing, in particular predictors miss, or mis-model from 20%
to 35% of standard reference proteins, while codon lookup calculations recover nearly all
reference proteins.

This table shows the percentage of matches to reference proteins that ORF computations
will produce from the mRNA sequences of those same reference genes. The codon-lookup
translators have few mismatches (3% to 6%) to the reference, while the predictors have
large degrees of mis-match (20% to 35%) to reference.

For most uses with transcriptomes, the simpler codon lookup for longest ORF is the best
first step, and will match public gene/protein databases. Various coding/non-coding
metrics can be applied after basic ORF computations, and homology to reference genes are
measured, as part of gene set validations. In my experience the non-coding tests make
mistakes, calling known coding genes as non-coding often enough that you want to defer
this metric until after measuring for for known protein homology.

Three methods (evg,ncbi,trin_long) are standard codon table lookup translation of nucleic triplets
  to amino acid, tabulating longest ORF, and all ORFs as a first step.
Three methods (gmark_gmp, gmark_gmst, trin_pred) are predictors based on  statistical models of 
  coding sequences, including coding/non-coding metrics, intron/exon models, 
  sequence signal statistical modeling for HMM  prediction of genes on chromosomes.
  
ORFs are calculated from the public  mRNA sequences for listed references, then compared
to reference proteins of same mRNA, for identity (end-to-end), identical substring (one is
contained in the other), different in some other way, or missing test ORF. 
Ambiguous code/noncode sequences exist, some are true biology ("NORF" is one term), 
some artifacts or ncRNA with computable ORF.

 stdorf_evg: evigene/cdna_bestorf.pl -noutrorf -fullorf -cdna human18nc.mrna
  stdorf_evg choice is always complete protein, if it exists.  This matches well to reference
  gene sets, but will lose homolog of partial proteins from fragment mRNA assemblies.

 bestorf_evg: evigene/cdna_bestorf.pl -cdna human18nc.mrna   defaults are: -utrorf -bestorf
  bestorf_evg choice is between longest complete protein, or a longer partial protein,
  determined by ratio of sizes ( complete >= 85%  of longest is default).
 
 trindec_long: TransDecoder.LongOrfs : all ORFs/mRNA of good size ( ~10 ORF per transcript)
  this is a near equivalent to evg, ncbi basic ORF codon lookup, but returns most computed
  orfs per mRNA, rather than longest, and does not chose shorter full orfs over partials.

 trindec_pred: TransDecoder.Predict : uses statistical modeling of mRNA sequence, attempts to
  discriminate coding vs non-coding ORFs.
