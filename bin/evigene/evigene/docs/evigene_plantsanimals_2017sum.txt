Recent Animal and Plant gene set reconstructions with EvidentialGene:
Comparisons to other popular and recent gene reconstructions
D.G. Gilbert, gilbertd at indiana.edu, 2016/2017
------------

Comparison to gene sets of other methods, including Pac-Bio RNA
sequencing, Trinity-Illumina assembly, and genome gene models, indicate
the Evigene methods are more accurate than commonly used methods.

In particular, for 3 plant species sets, Illumina RNA assemblies done
according to Evigene methods surpass Pac-Bio RNA genes not only in total gene set
accuracy, but in per-locus accuracy, where both methods recover some transcripts,
for primary, alternate and paralog transcript reconstruction.  Trinity
assembled Illumina RNA gene sets are likewise incomplete compared to
Evigene's multiple-assembler/reduction approach.

In comparison to genome-modeled gene sets, that are derived from many 
sources of gene evidence (prediction on chromosomes, RNA, other species proteins),
Evigene's RNA-only constructions often surpass accuracy of those modeled
genes. This is likely due to the greater complexity of merging many evidence 
sources in modeled genes, with greater chances of mis-modeling.

These measures of gene set completeness are based on the two basic
gene evidence data of protein homology across species, and recovery 
of expressed sequence evidence.

Evigene Illumina-RNA versus PacBio RNA comparisons include below summarized
Arabidopsis model plant, Zea mays corn, and pine trees.  

Evigene vs Trinity-only comparisons include these plants and animals
such as Bemisia whitefly, Daphnia water fleas, Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes,
honey bee, mice, fishes and others (including several by independent authors of animal
and plant gene sets).

Evigene versus genome modeled sets include those produced by NCBI EGAP and
MAKER pipelines, AUGUSTUS and similar gene modelers, for Arabidopsis, corn,
pine and other plants, and animals including mosquitos, water fleas, honey bee,
and others.

Zebrafish model animal is added for 2017-Dec reconstruction with Evigene methods,
compared with the modelled gene sets of NCBI and Ensembl, surpassing both on
average for complete fish/vertebrate protein homology and intron recovery. This
draft evigene zebrafish set contains incomplete genes however, as with arabidopsis,
only a small subset of RNA data was used, and selecting that subset to include
full expression of all genes is difficult as most studies provide RNA of specific
tissues for experimental approaches.
