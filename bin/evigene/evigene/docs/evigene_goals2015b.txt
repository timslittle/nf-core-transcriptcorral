Evigene-N
---------
Non-coding RNA genes are now discarded by Evigene-M (the mRNA classifier),
but of course they are genes important to organisms, and should be 
classifiable from RNA-seq assemblies or transcripts that include substantial non-coding
expressed genes.

Evigene-N can be modified from parts of Evigene-M pipeline, for non-coding RNA genes,
with small amounts of work to leverage existing code:
a. prerequisite Evigene-M is run to classify good mRNA genes, 
b. subtract mRNA transcript okay set from input transcript pool.
c. tr2ncrna.pl, ie. tr2aacds.pl modified, for full transcript alignment classification
   instead of coding sequence classification.

Outputs would initially be
   okncrnaset/ with primary (longest) and alternates of same locus, determined
again by exon-size or better high idenity alignments, and redundant discards
including perfect fragments of longer ncRNA transcripts.

Without additional methods or databases of known ncRNA, the result set will include
some rather large set of partial transcript artifacts that differ, and may or may not be
biological loci.  Still it is a step toward subdividing the "dropset" discarded
transcripts into possible biological ncRNA genes and probably redundant artifacts
of assembly process.

Evigene-G
---------
The genome gene construction portion of Evigene is "done", to sufficient detail that
it works reliable, producing accurate gene sets, in my author's hands. But it has 
poor/limited documentation.  It isn't wildly different from other genome gene combining tools, 
but I think it has enough value to warrant that final step of making it consumer friendly 
(or at least usable:)

Evigene-GM 
----------
Combining mRNA assembled and genome-gene modeled genes remains a valuable goal, 
one that many genome projects out there would use if/when they realize that 
mRNA assembled genes really are often improvements on genome modelled genes.

It is a goal that has however more problems than may be obvious at first thought.
The basic problem is resolving discrepancies between these two organizing principles:
  G. genes are locations of exons on a genome
  M. genes are expressed, assembled RNA (m or nc)
These are *supposed* to give the same biological answer, but for small expression/location
effects.  But discrepancies when you have both are rather more common than expected (ie. 50%)
for current genome assemblies of non-model organisms, and current RNA-seq expression experiments, 
for reasons that include genome assembly mistakes, gene assembly mistakes, 
mapping genome<>gene mistakes, heterozygosity and population variation in the above sequences, 
repeats and duplicates in the above, seqencing errors, ...

Having both M + G gene sets, independently produced, allows for stronger validation and
better accuracy, in theory, but makes for more work resolving these discrepancies.

Evigene-M-Genome-Assembly-Assist
--------------------------------
An offshoot of above, resolving G and M discrepancies, is that some/many discrepancies
are in genome assembly, esp. with current short read technology.  Since Evigene-M genes
assembled from mRNA can be independently validated thru other species orthology, those
valid genes at least offer an independent assessments for genome assemblies at those
gene regions, often regions of high value as these are well-known-orthologs.

Besides the simple validations of "does this gene align properly and fully to genome assembly?",
these gene transcripts can be used for genome assembly, as scaffolding inputs to join
gene spanning scaffolds, as gap filling sequences, and with proper helper software, as
pseudo-genomic dna paired-end reads to more fully and accurately assemble genome regions
where these genes are supposed to be accurately located.


Evigene-Submit
--------------
Public database submission methods are developed and working now (evigene/scripts/evgmrna2tsa.pl), 
so that others can use this following transcript assemblies, including fully annotated and
error checked/resolved transcript assemblies for submission to NCBI TSA,
genome assemblies annotated by transcript gene assemblies (NCBI Genbank/WGS). 
There remain project-specific problems and such to improved automated use of these.
