<h1>EvidentialGene Voting Machine</h1>


Genome map views include a method for you to vote for the
best gene models at a locus.
For example, at this 
<a href="http://server7.eugenes.org:8091/gbrowse/cgi-bin/gbrowse/aphid2/">
Pea aphid2 Gbrowse map</a>, choose a best model by clicking on the model.

Choices include <ol>
<li> Best model, promote to best for a locus
<li> Alternate transcript, call as alternate were evidence supports
<li> Drop or demote as poor model
<li> None, say no models are good enough for this locus
<li> Skip this locus, saying there is no gene here (or not enough
     evidence for one).
</ol>
<p>

These choices are then placed in <b>A BEST User Choice</b> Track.  They will be visible
when you Update Image, or turn off Display Setting: [ ] Cache tracks to update each time.
<p>


You can <u>View Gene Details</u>, with annotations of evidence for the model,
and you can <u>View Changes Table</u>, with a list of all genes voted for.
<br>

Your expert choice of gene models will improve the automated best model
selection, which is not as good at this as a human can be.
<p>

For model choices, see the GBrowse Tracks for Predictions,
as well as Rnaseq or EST assemblies, and Protein homology gene models.
