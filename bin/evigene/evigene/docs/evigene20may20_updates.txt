EvidentialGene source code changes, 2020may from 2020mar

This is mainly a bug fix release to version 4 of 2020 march. Some of
the corrections are for obscure data bugs, many deal with Evigene
SRA2Genes pipeline components used after the redundancy reduction tool
tr2aacds4.

Components revised:
  cdna_bestorf.pl, cdna_proteins.pm : corrected obscure bug, mRNA output from 
    reverse UTRORF subsequences were miscalculated, AA and CDS were/are correct.
  trclass_resolve_strandmix.pl : stranded RNA-seq detection, no_maybe option
  asmrna_trimvec.pl and asmrna_vecscreen.pl : expanded contamination screens, and
    replaced NCBI vecscreen with blastn
  trclass2pubset.pl : revised sequence set publication
  pubset2submit.pl  : revised NCBI TSA submission data sets
  evgmrna2tsa.pl    : obsolete, replaced by trclass2pubset.pl
  
  docs/EvigeneR/evigene4_outputs_brief.txt : summarizes data outputs of SRA2Genes (EvigeneR),
    from tr2aacds4 and other steps.
  
These are new, improved options:

  asmrna_trimvec.pl and asmrna_vecscreen.pl are revised and expanded to
    screen transcript sequences against several contamination databases.
    asmrna_vecscreen is a new component, using NCBI blastn instead of vecscreen,
    that handles these contaminant references: sequencing vectors (as UniVec), common
    eukaryote contaminants (eg. E.coli bacteria), common species rRNA, and foreign species
    chromosome DNA. SRA2Genes/refset/contam/ distributes these sequence data, obtained from NCBI. 
    These use and follow NCBI contaminant screening data sets and methods.
    asmrna_trimvec also checks and corrects for gaps and mismatched mRNA/CDS sequences, and both
    now handle -ncrna (ie, without CDS).
    
  asmrna_vecscreen/trimvec recommended use vua SRA2Genes pipeline is at Step9B, following
    tr2aacds and tr2ncrna outputs, as inputs to vecscreen: okayset/mrna and ncrnaset/ncrna
    These screens adhere to NCBI Transcript Sequence Archive submission policy.
    
  trclass_resolve_strandmix (a script used by tr2aacds4): 
    -strandedrna: stranded RNA-seq detection and use for protein strand corrections,
      -stranded is default, as it seems reliable, -nostranded turns off this detection.

      Strand detection is logged as 'isStrandedRNA=1, f:990/r:10', meaning 99% of
      longest 1000 proteins have mRNA orientation, expected from assembly of 
      strand-specific RNA-seq. 
      'isStrandedRNA=0, f:510/r:490' means longest 1000 proteins are randomly
      oriented, expected from non-specific RNA-seq.
      
    -nomaybe : turns off output of ambiguous-stranded proteins.  Default is to
      output both forward/reverse strand proteins for same transcript, when
      evidence is ambiguous.  Stranded RNA-seq and -stranded are evidence that also
      turns off ambiguity. 
    
  "tr2aacds4.pl -reorient" invokes trclass_resolve_strandmix, and is recommended usage.  
    "env reor_nomaybe=1 tr2aacds4.pl -reorient .. " invokes "trclass_resolve_strandmix -nomaybe .."
