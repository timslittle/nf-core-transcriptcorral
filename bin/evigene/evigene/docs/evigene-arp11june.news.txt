Evidential Gene models for pea aphid are available now at
 http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/pea_aphid2/genes/

Evidential gene sets are built/in-progress for 3 other
arthropods and one plant.  If you have an arthropod genome
with lots of new expression/other gene evidence that wants
good gene models, please contact me.   I will miss this
week's Arthropod Genomics Symposium at Kansas City, to my
regret. If you run into anyone there with the problem of too
much gene data that is not being turned into good models,
have them contact me.

The software for Evidential Gene is progressing, and is
partly available now, with more work this summer to document
and simplify its use. It can be used by other genome
informaticians.

  Nevd for EST, Pro, RNA is total span of non-overlapping
  reads or alignments, but count for valid unique introns from
  spliced reads.  * This Daphnia magna genome assembly is
  incomplete, and genes for now are limited to members of
  the daphnia consortium.  


For pea aphid,
36,500 genes are located in aphid2_evigene8f gene set:
  14,000 are fully supported by evidence (expression/orthology),
  24,000 have above 66% evidence support,
         the remainder have evidence but at lower levels.
  23,200 have paralogs to pea aphid genes, above 33% identity
  13,500 have orthologs to other species, above 33% identity
    5000 alternate transcripts among 2700 genes add to these primary transcripts.
    4400 are non-coding or poorly coding genes.
     270 have long genes with valid long introns, span > 100 Kb (acyp2eg0001707t1 nears 1 Mb;
         honeybee has 240 long genes, fruitfly has 50).

There are also now NCBI Gnomon/RefSeq for pea aphid assembly 2. Using
my criteria the Evidential gene set is better, if not yet best at
all loci.

  EST, Protein, RNA are spans of evidence (Nevd) and proportion
  recovered in 3 prediction sets.  Introns are valid splice
  locations from EST/RNA reads.
  
  Ortholog SameLocus is protein homology of 3 prediction sets 
  to Uniprot-arthropods from loci with all 3 predictors:
  SameLocus_N is count of models with Uniprot hit (e<1e-5), 
  SameLocus_Bits is average bitscore,
  SameLocus_Nbest is count where predictor has best homology.
