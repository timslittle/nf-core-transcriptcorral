  Consensus criterion is an important addition, to retain transcripts where
  the coding sequence (protein) is supported by identical assemblies across
  assembler methods.
  
  Adam Voshall brought this to my attention, with this thesis,
  https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/computerscidiss/145
  "Consensus Ensemble Approaches Improve De Novo Transcriptome Assemblies"
  
  showing that Evigene tr2aacds (and asmrna_dupfilter3 classifier) reduces,
  drastically, the number of perfect protein matches to a reference gene
  set, versus the number of perfects from individual assemblers.  The
  reduction is due to longest-ORF often not being the "true" coding sequence.

  There is a puzzle here, as extensive measures by myself & others, show the
  longest-ORF criteria does return greatest average alignment, and most
  genes with high alignment, for proteins or CDS aligned to reference
  genes.  The difference, by digging thru discrepancies, is mostly at the
  99+% level, where perfect means 100% identity, a harder criteria to
  reach.  Longest-ORF selection by tr2aacds is pulling rare? assemblies of
  genes that are slightly longer (e.g. 1..10 aminos, or <=1% longer) than
  many "true" reference genes.  More work to determine if these are artifacts to
  be dropped or valid, if slightly different transcripts.

  This effect is dramatic, to me, that a gene set with measurably
  best overall alignments to reference genes, also has worst perfect-alignments:

      PacBio   21964    48.2    16.1
      -------------------------------
      
  This effect, best overall align from longest CDS vs perfect align from slightly shorter CDS,  
  appears to be similar over range of animals (pig, fish) + plants, different RNA sources, 
  different assemblers.  Individual assemblers have same rank order for both overall + perfect
  align recovery, but Evigene's longest orf selection flips its recovery.
  
  tr2aacds should retain all valid, or likely valid, coding transcripts, removing
  only measurably redundant or fragment models.  To that end, AACON consensus scoring
  and classification is added.  
  
  tr2aacds will attempt to score input transcripts for CDS-consensus, using
  ID patterns that distinguish assembler sources (as added by Evigene trformat.pl, 
  but customizable), or/and by SRA2Genes with its knowledge of separate assemblies
  in  trsets/.  Consensus is measured as identical coding sequences, produced by 2+
  different assembly methods (programs, or kmer setting, or data slices).
  
  "Fastanrdb all.cds > nr.cds", as now used for assembly reduction, is also used 
  for consensus detection.
  
  Input to asmrna_dupfilter3c.pl is a table of
    tr_ID <tab> consensus_score
  where any score > 0 means the tr_ID will be retained in okayset, suitably classed
  (generally as an alternate to longer ORF).  This is similar to how homology table
  scores are used, 
    tr_ID <tab> ref_ID <tab> homology_score
  
  Mistakes in automated consensus generation could create a large table, with net
  effect of no reduction to over-assembly, i.e. all inputs are okayed.  Prelim. tests
  suggest a relative minority of input transcripts have consensus across
  assemblers, more than are matched as "true" reference models, but only a few percent
  of total input transcripts.  One likely modification will be to test other 
  CDS/transcript qualities with consensus score, to drop consensus-trash models.
  
  This usage is then 
    tr2aacds2c.pl -aconsensus[=acons_options] .. to enable consensus scoring, 
      default mode measures consensus in trset.nrcds, writes trset.consensus table
    e.g.
    $evigene/scripts/prot/tr2aacds2c.pl -aconsensus -tidy -log -ncpu 8 -cdna input_models.cdna
      
    asmrna_dupfilter3c.pl -aconsensus trset.consensus  -anames trset.names (blastp scores + refnames) 
     (asmrna_dupfilter is called by tr2aacds)

  Initial test for using aconsensus with tr2aacds is positive, where 2+ assemblers
  agree, the perfect matches to ref gene set are boosted to as good as, or better than,
  best of  individual assemblers.  The total added okay transcripts, almost all in 
  okalt alternate set, is about 30% above non-consensus set.  This is less than 2%
  of the total over-assembly set.

  Sum: 2,500 newly okay transcripts are valid by perfect match to Arath-AT gene set, of
      33,000 okay transcripts added with aconsensus.  Need further gene qualities to
      measure which of consensus-added, vs non-consensus but longer-orf, are valid or redundant.

      ==========================================     


  Consensus suggests a more reliable transcript model than those unique to
  one method.  However this is disputed by cases where majority-vote fails
  to pick the most reliable model (reliable as determined by external
  evidence), while longest-ORF does.

  As an example, the longest vertebrate gene TITIN,  over 100,000 coding
  bases, is difficult to assemble accurately.  With longest-ORF
  selection from among many assembly variants, one can be found to be
  fully accurate, among many with indels breaking the coding sequence
  (often with insertions that make a longer transcript).
