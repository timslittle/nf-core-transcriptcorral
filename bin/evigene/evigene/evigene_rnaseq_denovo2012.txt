The two I've used most are Trinity and Velvet/Oases.  There are papers
by authors of both, essentially saying their's is best.  I find them
close now (trinity was poorer last year).  I get somewhat better results
with Velvet/Oases but it is a bit harder to set up and run than Trinity.

Just now I'm testing the new Soap-transcript from BGI colleauges at
that meeting.  It may be as good or better than the two above. The
documentation however is poorer, making it harder to get started with.

To work well for transcript data, both Velvet and Soap should be
run in multi-kmer mode.  That is the main option, kmer size being
the read chunk size.  For transcript data, a subset of kmer ranging from 
21 bases up to read size should be used and results combined.
(eg. for 100 bp reads, I use something like 89,69,49,39,29,25,23).
The lower kmers assemble more data but higher kmers are often more
accurate where they work.  Trinity doesn't need this.

Tesults with these also depend on species and data sets you use.
If it is a "small" data set, Trinity may do worse than Velvet (small
a year ago was under 100 million reads, paired end, 50-75 bases).

These all more or less require paired-end reads to do well, Velvet and
Soap allow you to mix read types, pair insert sizes, but not that yet 
for Trinity.  Strand-specific reads help prevent joining neighbor genes 
(if they are reversed).

All of these assemblers give you more assemblies than are real.
Some filtering is needed.  Eg for multi-kmer programs, many across kmers 
are same, or nearly same, transcript. Programs like CD-Hit can do that 
depending on what you want as results.  

These de-novo assemblers are doing better now than the
genome mapped one (cufflinks is the only good example), but
they need a minimum read coverage of at least a few reads over your
transcript, so the 1-transcript per cell genes are still hard to
pick up.

They all require that you reformat input data some to suit
them.  Velvet and Soap are the most catholic in data formats
they accept.

SOAP seems to be faster and require less memory than the other
two. Velvet needs the most memory (can be 100s of GB for billion
read sets).  Look for a machine/cluster with at least 64 GB memory,
250 GB to 500 GB is good.  All these programs use multiple cpus.
If you are US researcher, NSF-funded TeraGrid/XSEDE.org offer these 
for asking.
