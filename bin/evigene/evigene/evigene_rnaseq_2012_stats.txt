Transcript assemblies with protein orthology assessment for 3 Eukaryotes.
Don Gilbert, 2012 June, gilbertd at indiana edu

Protein orthology is used as a way to biologically validate and assess
transcript assemblies.  This measures relative completeness of
a protein transcriptome (relative to related species).  Only best matching
transcript to an ortholog gene family is counted, so result is not
influenced by extra gene copies (be they real or artifact).  Both the
strength of alignment (as blastp bitscore) and protein size are measured.
Gene families with at least 3 species are required, and the median family
gene is used for scoring, so influences of species-nearness are limited. 
Average bitscore to a common orthology family set then allows ranking of
gene sets from same species, different software, and between species.
Also useful are average bitscore to all families, as a measure of 
completeness of a gene set, and per-set bitscores.

No model species were evaluated, those with reference gene sets
that can be compared.  This evaluation relies on gene family
orthology as the primary measure. Other measures of transcript assembly
are useful and given elsewhere : coverage completeness and identity
to expressed sequence, intron validation for genome-mapped data, etc.

Transcript assemblers evaluated
  Velvet/Oases version v1.2.03/o0.2.06 2012.feb : de-novo assembly
  SOAPdenovo-Trans, version 2011.dec.22 : de-novo assembly
  Trinity, version 2012.march.17   : de-novo assembly
  Cufflinks, version 1.3, 2012.jan : genome-mapped assembly
Note these were current versions at the start of this evaluation,
but as of this writing they are mostly superceded by newer releases.

Three species are reported here:  
  The insect Locusta migratoria transcriptome set is published and available at NCBI-SRA.
There is no genome assembly for this species.  Methods, data pointers, and result transcript
assemblies are at http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/locust/
  The plant Theobroma cacao genome project publication in is preparation, 2012.  A high
quality draft genome assembly is used here.
  The crustacean Daphnia magna genome project is still collecting data.  A draft
partial genome assembly is used here.


These results in summary are
- Transcript assemblers now recover a large fraction of a species protein families,
  as complete or near complete equivalents to related species genes.
- Three de-novo assemblers tested here are closely ranked, and ranking depends on
  the particular species and data set used.
    Locust : Velvet/O  > Trinity > SOAPTrans
    Daphnia: Velvet/O  > SOAPTrans > Trinity >> Cufflinks 
    Cacao  : SOAPTrans = Velvet/O > Trinity >> Cufflinks 
    
- The one genome-mapped assembler, Cufflinks, is trailing behind de-novo assemblers
  in quality of modeled genes. Other genome-mapped assemblers, Scripture and
  IsoLasso, appear to be not ready to compare or not actively developed.
  This is of concern as genome-mapped assembly has in theory advantages over
  de-novo assembly, of using genome information.
- Genome mapped gene modelling returns valid orthology genes that are not 
  assembled from large transcript data sets.  E.g. Augustus predictor with
  gene evidence.
- The most complete gene set is derived from several of these methods, when
  suitable evidence scoring is applied to select best model per locus. No
  method does better than others at all loci, and each method does better
  than others at some loci.
- Genes assembled from RNA transcripts without genomes is a valid way to 
  discover a species gene set, with caveats that dicriminating paralogs from
  alternates at one locus, and other refinements, need a genome assembly.

Other species evaluated with early versions of the assembly software are pea aphid and
jewel wasp.  Results for those are generally consistent with these, except that the
main de-novo assemblers have all improved, and now are relatively closely matched
in ability.  For example, this paper reports on 2011 versions and gives results
similar to our results from 2011, but the software rankings have changed for
newer versions:

Brief methods
  For de-novo assembly the multi-kmer method is used for velvet,soap: 
  e.g. for locust kset="31 23 39", for cacao and dmagna kset="89..25" in 8 steps.
  Generally kmer close to read size returns fewer but more complete proteins.
  Insert-size configuration for velvet,soap is done as per data producer's info.
  Trinity does not use kmers nor insert sizes.  
  min tr sizes to keep: 160 for velvet, soap, 200 for trinity (default)
  
Processing transcripts of soap,velvet,trinity
  transcript outputs for locust: 
  soap ntr=362748, velvet ntr=437687, trinity ntr=118,000
  
  1. reformat to common headers.
  2. fastanrdb (exonerate), remove identical tr (mostly <5%)
  3. maketraa2 : find longest orf proteins from tr, minsize=60aa  
      annotate %CDS and classify as okutr=%CDS>60, utrbad=%CDS<35, utrpoor=60<%CDS<35, 
  4. remove similar aa from trset.aa with cd-hit
      cd-hit -c 0.95 -d 0 -i $nam.ok.aa
      cd-hit-2d -d 0 -i $nam.ok.aa -i2 $nam.poor.aa
  5. blastp trset.okpoor.aa x species.db
      locust orthology set is ARPx3 (arthropods.eugenes.org/arthropods/orthologs/ARP3x/)
      drosmel,daphniaplx,jewelwasp,tribolium,peaaphid,ixodestick,spidermite,human,zbrafish
      This set is already classified into ortho gene families
  6. measure locust tr-set best match to ortho families with 3+ species.
      6a. Bits: bitscore to median family protein
      6b. dSize: size difference from median family protein.
